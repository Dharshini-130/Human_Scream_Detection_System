# Human Scream Detection using Deep Learning

This project detects and classifies human scream audio into three distinct categories using deep learning. It uses *MFCC audio features, and models like **CNN* and *LSTM, trained on a custom dataset. The project includes a **Flask web interface* for real-time audio upload and prediction.

---

## Project Overview

Human scream detection plays a key role in safety, surveillance, and emotion recognition. This system classifies uploaded .wav audio files into:

- *Dangerous Scream*  
- *Normal Conversation*  
- *Happy Scream*

Built using Python, Keras, Librosa, and Flask.

## Features

Upload .wav audio via web UI  
MFCC feature extraction using Librosa  
Trained deep learning models (CNN / LSTM)  
Clean prediction display in browser  
Works fully offline after setup

---

## Models Used

- MFCC feature extraction from raw audio  
- Trained *CNN model* on extracted features  
- (Optional) LSTM model (can be swapped in)  
- (Advanced) Experiments with SVM, KNN possible
